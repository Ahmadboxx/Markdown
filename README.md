# Markdown
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

Gists
Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
Files with the .md or .markdown extension
For more information, see “Writing on GitHub” in the GitHub Help

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
Syntax guide
Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

The term “IDE” comes from Integrated Development Environment. It is intended as a set of tools that all work together: text editor, compiler, build or make integration, debugging, etc. Virtually all IDEs are tied specifically to a language or framework or tightly collected set of languages or frameworks. Some examples: Visual Studio for .NET and other Microsoft languages, RubyMine for Ruby, IntelliJ for Java, XCode for Apple technologies.

A text editor just display plain text in one color (black on white, usually, often with monospaced font), with more or less advanced facilities (search, replace, perhaps with regexes, macros / automation, etc.). A good text editor might be optimized to handle very large files, etc.

A code editor is, of course, able to do all of the above, and more. The "more" part is, unsurprisingly, aimed at editing source code (programs, textual data like Json or XML, etc.).
